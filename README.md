# Maven-Toys-Analysis
Sales analysis of the Maven Toys Chain Stores in Mexico, using SQL and Power BI.

# Project Background
**Maven Toys** is a toy store chain with multiple store locations across Mexico. The company has transactional data available from January 2022 through September 2023, which includes detailed information about products and store locations.

The leadership team at Maven Toys requires a simple, interactive report that enables them to monitor key business metrics and observe high-level trends. This project involves connecting and profiling the data, creating a relational data model, adding calculated measures and fields, and building an interactive report to support data-driven decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

  **- Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by region, focusing on Revenue, Profit, and Year Over Year (YoY).
  **- Product Performance:** An analysis of Elistâ€™s various products, understanding their impact on sales.
  **- Stores Analysis:** An evaluation of sales by store.

6. The data shows a gradual increase in sales from January ($542,554) to April 2017 ($681,072). Afterwards, sales trends downwards until August ($489,422). Given that this timeframe coincides with the summer season, individuals are likely to be more engaged in outdoor activities which may explain the reason for decreased sales.
