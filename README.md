# Maven-Toys-Analysis
Sales analysis of the Maven Toys Chain Stores in Mexico, using SQL and Power BI.

# Project Background
**Maven Toys** is a toy store chain with multiple store locations across Mexico. The company has transactional data available from January 2022 through September 2023, which includes detailed information about products and store locations.

The leadership team at Maven Toys requires a simple, interactive report that enables them to monitor key business metrics and observe high-level trends. This project involves connecting and profiling the data, creating a relational data model, adding calculated measures and fields, and building an interactive report to support data-driven decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

  **- Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by region, focusing on Revenue, Profit, and Year Over Year (YoY).
  
  **- Product Performance:** An analysis of Elist’s various products, understanding their impact on sales.
  
  **- Stores Analysis:** An evaluation of sales by store.

## **Sales Analysis**
![](https://i.imgur.com/RKCQCxQ.png)
- The Toy Company is demonstrating robust performance in 2023. This is evidenced by consistent monthly gains, notably 37.72% in January and 40.63% in March, directly contributing to enhanced profitability.
- **Seasonal trends:** The data shows a gradual increase in sales from January ($542,554) to April 2022 ($681,073). Afterwards, sales trends downwards until August ($489,423). Given that this timeframe coincides with the summer season, individuals are likely to be more engaged in outdoor activities which may explain the reason for decreased sales. After August, monthly sales trends upwards constantly from $585,844 in September to $661,304 in November. These three months of increases culminate in a massive spike to $877,203 in December, which is the highest sales amount recorded in any month. This end of year occurrence is likely due to increased demand for Christmas.
- In 2023, there is a decrease in monthly sales for two months to $722,632 in February, followed by a significant increase in March to $883,516. For the next six months of 2023, the sales data follows a similar trend to that of 2022, remaining relatively constant from April to June and **then decreasing from July to December.**
- Geographically, all store locations are contributing positively, with Airport stores leading at 37.5% YOY growth, underscoring broad market penetration and effective retail execution.

- Product category analysis reveals Art & Crafts as a hyper-growth segment (251.9% YOY), alongside strong performance in Sports & Outdoors, Games, and Toys. However, despite Electronics being the second most profitable product category, the Electronics category is a critical outlier with a 27.8% YOY decline.

- **Games, Arts & Crafts, and Sports & Ourdoors** have seasonal trends peaking in December. **Arts & Crafts** have been on an **upward trend** since August 2022 while **Electronics** have been on a **steady decline** since January 2022.

## **Product Performance**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/kprfbLC.png)
- **The Art & Crafts category** witnessed the most drastic revenue decline, plummeting by 251.90%. Key products like "Magic Sand" (-2482.23%) and "Barrel O' Slime" (-1048.60%) were primary contributors to this heavy loss, signaling an urgent need for restructuring or reconsideration.

- Bright Spots and Potential Within **Toys and Electronics Categories**: Despite overall declines, **the Toys category** showcased strong growth from "Mr. Potatohead" (+5473.91%) and "Dino Egg" (+151.19%), with "Lego Bricks" also growing by 16.86% and being the highest YTD revenue generator in the category ($905,014).
  
- In **Electronics**, Gamer Headphones surged by 416.58%, highlighting promising niche segments for future investment. **Colorbuds** experienced the most significant decline, dropping sharply by 53.08% ($931,434 YTD compared to $437,048 LYTD). This product held the highest LYTD revenue within its category but faced a severe downturn.

- **Barrel O' Slime** was the top-selling product by unit volume (61K YTD Units), yet it simultaneously suffered one of the most significant revenue drops (over 1000%), raising critical questions about its pricing strategy, production costs, or overall profitability.

  
## **Stores Analysis**

![](https://i.imgur.com/w8xQHik.png)
- YTD Revenue Concentrated in Top Stores: Ciudad ($0.26M), Guadalajara ($0.21M), and Toluca 1 ($0.21M) lead in Year-To-Date revenue, indicating a concentration of sales contribution from these key outlets.

- Positive YOY Revenue Growth Across Many Stores: Notably, several stores shown in the chart exhibit impressive Year-Over-Year revenue growth, with Culiacan 1 leading at 103.51% and Puebla 1 achieving 90.30%. Other stores like Monterrey, Zacatecas, and Oaxaca 1 also grew between 53.13% and 81.05%, reflecting strong individual store performance.

- Severe Inventory Shortages Across Multiple Key Products: A wide range of "Top Revenue Products," including Lego Bricks (0.29-0.85 days of inventory), Magic Sand (0.45-0.68 days of inventory), Action Figure (0.47-0.77 days of inventory), and Dino Egg (0.55-0.85 days of inventory), face critically low stock levels (often below 1 day) across various stores.

- "Colorbuds" Continues to Face Inventory Issues: The "Colorbuds" product, which already saw a 53.08% overall revenue decline, is reconfirmed to have critical inventory problems at stores like Saltillo 2, showing only 0.56 days of stock.

## Deep-Dive Dashboard Exploration
### Analysis of "Colorbuds" Sharp Decline (Based on Store Analysis):

![](https://i.imgur.com/AGyeNJG.png)
- Colorbuds experienced a significant YTD revenue drop of 53.08% compared to LYTD (from $931,434 LYTD to $437,048 YTD), despite being the highest LYTD revenue product within its category.

- Data clearly indicates the main reason for the sharp decline is a severe and widespread inventory shortage at stores. All listed stores show "Days of Inventory" for Colorbuds below 1 day, meaning the product is consistently out of stock almost immediately.

- Despite stockout issues, the "AVG Daily Units Sold" for "Colorbuds" remains relatively high in many stores (e.g., Guadalajara 3 at 21.43 units/day, Monterrey 2 at 17.30 units/day), suggesting strong market demand that cannot be converted into sales due to product unavailability.

- Even in regions showing overall store revenue growth (e.g., Guadalajara's total YOY increase of 445.24%), specific branches like Guadalajara 3 still face critically low "Colorbuds" inventory (only 0.84 days of stock), indicating a systemic supply chain problem for this particular product.

## Recommendation
- **Resolve "Colorbuds" Inventory Crisis Immediately**: Prioritize restocking "Colorbuds" at all affected stores to recover lost revenue due to persistent stockouts. This product is in high demand but severely undersupplied.

- **Upgrade Inventory Management System**: Invest in an advanced, automated inventory tracking and reordering system. This will ensure top-selling products like "Lego Bricks" and "Dino Egg" remain in stock, preventing missed sales opportunities.

- **Restructure Arts & Crafts Category:** Analyze the significant revenue decline of "Magic Sand" and "Barrel O' Slime," considering pricing adjustments or discontinuation if unprofitable. Simultaneously, introduce new, high-potential products to capitalize on the category's growth potential.

- **Develop Mid-Year Sales Strategies:** Implement specific marketing campaigns and promotions for the quieter summer months (July-September) to counter the observed historical sales decline during this period.

- **Replicate Top Store Successes:** Study and apply effective strategies from high-performing stores like Downtown and Culiacan 1 across the entire retail network to boost overall performance.

- **Optimize Holiday Season Preparedness:** Begin planning for the Q4 2025 holiday season early. Ensure ample stock and strong marketing campaigns to fully leverage the year's largest sales spike.
