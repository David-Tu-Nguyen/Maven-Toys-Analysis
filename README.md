# Maven-Toys-Analysis
Sales analysis of the Maven Toys Chain Stores in Mexico, using SQL and Power BI.

# Project Background
**Maven Toys** is a toy store chain with multiple store locations across Mexico. The company has transactional data available from January 2022 through September 2023, which includes detailed information about products and store locations.

The leadership team at Maven Toys requires a simple, interactive report that enables them to monitor key business metrics and observe high-level trends. This project involves connecting and profiling the data, creating a relational data model, adding calculated measures and fields, and building an interactive report to support data-driven decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

  **- Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by region, focusing on Revenue, Profit, and Year Over Year (YoY).
  **- Product Performance:** An analysis of Elist’s various products, understanding their impact on sales.
  **- Stores Analysis:** An evaluation of sales by store.

## **Sales Analysis**
![](https://i.imgur.com/RKCQCxQ.png)
- The Toy Company is demonstrating robust performance in 2023. This is evidenced by consistent monthly gains, notably 37.72% in January and 40.63% in March, directly contributing to enhanced profitability.
- **Seasonal trends:** The data shows a gradual increase in sales from January ($542,554) to April 2022 ($681,073). Afterwards, sales trends downwards until August ($489,423). Given that this timeframe coincides with the summer season, individuals are likely to be more engaged in outdoor activities which may explain the reason for decreased sales. After August, monthly sales trends upwards constantly from $585,844 in September to $661,304 in November. These three months of increases culminate in a massive spike to $877,203 in December, which is the highest sales amount recorded in any month. This end of year occurrence is likely due to increased demand for Christmas.
- In 2023, there is a decrease in monthly sales for two months to $722,632 in February, followed by a significant increase in March to $883,516. For the next six months of 2023, the sales data follows a similar trend to that of 2022, remaining relatively constant from April to June and **then decreasing from July to December.**
- Geographically, all store locations are contributing positively, with Airport stores leading at 37.5% YOY growth, underscoring broad market penetration and effective retail execution.

- Product category analysis reveals Art & Crafts as a hyper-growth segment (251.9% YOY), alongside strong performance in Sports & Outdoors, Games, and Toys. However, despite Electronics being the second most profitable product category, the Electronics category is a critical outlier with a 27.8% YOY decline.

- Of the three products offered in the **Electronics category,** the profit of $834,944 returned by **Colorbuds** makes it both the most profitable product of its category and overall, in the company. However, this was a 53.1% decline from the previous year despite selling 29,000 units, suggesting pricing, demand, or competitive pressures may be impacting performance. **Gamer Headphones** achieved strong growth, with revenue of $243,316 — a 416.6% increase year-over-year — driven by 12,000 units sold and a YTD profit of $70,000.
